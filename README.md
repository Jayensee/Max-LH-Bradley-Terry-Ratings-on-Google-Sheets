# Max-LH-Bradley-Terry-Ratings-on-Google-Sheets-
An implementation of maximum likelihood estimation of Bradley Terry ratings as a function on Google Sheets.

The input has to be an adjency matrix where the winners are in the rows and the losers in the columns. 
The names of the teams need to be in the same order in both the columns and the rows (you can just transpose one to get the other).
Make sure to include the names of the teams in the input to the function.

Here's an example:
